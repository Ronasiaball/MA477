    "In this project you will be working with the `incurance` dataset contained in the folder. The `insurance` dataset contains information of different people, and based on this information how much the insurance compay charges them. The ultimate goal is to predict the insurance charges for new people based on the historical information collected about each person. The features that have been collected are: `age, sex, bmi, children, smoker,` and `region`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with two separate sets: `insurance_train` which you will use to train your model and `insurance_test` which you will use to generate the predictions. Once you generate the predictions, you should save the results on an excel file and submit that to me. \n",

    "This project is about being able to take raw data and create a model that predicts what the insurance company charged its customers. I took the data provided by my instructor and had to address issues such as missing data and qualitative features. The training data had information about a person's age, sex, bmi, number of children, whether or not they are a smoker and the region they are from. To create a model that predicts the charges, I used both KNN and linear regression. When using the KNN regressor, I got a really low r-squared. However, I was able to create a linear regression model that had a r squared of 0.75. "
